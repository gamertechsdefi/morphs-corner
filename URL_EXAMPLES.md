# Article URL Examples

## New Title-Based URLs

Your articles now use SEO-friendly, title-based URLs instead of numeric IDs. Here are examples:

### Before (ID-based):
```
/articles/1
/articles/2
/articles/3
```

### After (Title-based):
```
/articles/how-to-make-money-online-with-crypto-airdrops
/articles/start-here-the-only-spot-trading-tips-you-need-in-2025
/articles/the-cbex-scam-in-nigeria-what-happened-why-it-matters-and-how-to-protect-yourself
/articles/understanding-blockchain-technology-a-beginners-complete-guide
/articles/defi-explained-your-gateway-to-decentralized-finance
/articles/cryptocurrency-wallets-complete-security-guide-for-2025
```

## URL Generation Rules

The `createSlug()` function converts titles to URLs using these rules:

1. **Convert to lowercase**: "How To Make Money" â†’ "how to make money"
2. **Remove special characters**: Keep only letters, numbers, spaces, and hyphens
3. **Replace spaces with hyphens**: "how to make money" â†’ "how-to-make-money"
4. **Remove multiple hyphens**: "how--to--make" â†’ "how-to-make"
5. **Remove leading/trailing hyphens**: "-how-to-make-" â†’ "how-to-make"

## Examples of Title â†’ URL Conversion

| Article Title | Generated URL Slug |
|---------------|-------------------|
| "How To Make Money Online With Crypto Airdrops" | `how-to-make-money-online-with-crypto-airdrops` |
| "Start Here: The Only Spot Trading Tips You Need In 2025" | `start-here-the-only-spot-trading-tips-you-need-in-2025` |
| "The CBEX Scam in Nigeria: What Happened, Why It Matters, and How..." | `the-cbex-scam-in-nigeria-what-happened-why-it-matters-and-how` |
| "Understanding Blockchain Technology: A Beginner's Complete Guide" | `understanding-blockchain-technology-a-beginners-complete-guide` |
| "DeFi Explained: Your Gateway to Decentralized Finance" | `defi-explained-your-gateway-to-decentralized-finance` |
| "Cryptocurrency Wallets: Complete Security Guide for 2025" | `cryptocurrency-wallets-complete-security-guide-for-2025` |

## Backward Compatibility

The system maintains backward compatibility:

1. **Slug lookup first**: `/articles/how-to-make-money-online-with-crypto-airdrops`
2. **ID lookup second**: `/articles/1` (still works)
3. **Title lookup third**: `/articles/How%20To%20Make%20Money%20Online%20With%20Crypto%20Airdrops`
4. **API fallback**: If not found locally, tries API
